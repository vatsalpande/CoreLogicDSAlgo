Bubble sort - Also called sinking sort algorithm
Checks every adjacent pair and swap them if they are not in sorted order.
Keeps on doing it until no sorting is needed and we have our sorted array

Best Case Performance - O(n);
Worst Case Performance - O(n^2)
Average Performance - O(n^2)
No Extra Space Needed

Step-by-step example
Take an array of numbers " 5 1 4 2 8", and sort the array from lowest number to greatest number using bubble sort. In each step, elements written in bold are being compared. Three passes will be required;

First Pass
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) → ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) → ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) → ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) → ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.

Second Pass
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) → ( 1 4 2 5 8 )
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) → ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) → ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) → ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
Now, the array is already sorted, but the algorithm does not know if it is completed. 
The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.

Third Pass
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) → ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) → ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) → ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) → ( 1 2 4 5 8 )



Similarly keep going until no sorting needed
